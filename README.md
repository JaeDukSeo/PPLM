# PPLM
This repo is the official codebase for my Medium article: [Controlling Text Generation for Language Models](https://towardsdatascience.com/controlling-text-generation-from-language-models-6334935e80cf?source=friends_link&sk=ead0e199030d9580f20fbce748f0c108).

To use this repo, first download the official PPLM repo from Uber AI:
`git clone git clone https://github.com/uber-research/PPLM`

Then, clone this repo and replace the existing run_pplm.py with the one in this repo (if you want to save the generated outputs).
Then follow the rest of the blog to see how you can generate text of a custom style. 
`generated_romance.txt` contains the generated book summaries using romance BoW.
